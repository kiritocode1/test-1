        Find the largest palindrome made from the 
        product of two 3-digit numbers.
        as we can see a palindrome product is something like for eg 
        9009 ---> 90 --> 100-1=99  and then what i see is  91 which is like 
        N = str(no)[0]
        A = no-1
        palindromehalf = 1000/A * int(N)  - int(N)
        now this is true for like upto 400 and beyond  , for 400  
        its kinda moot but i think for like that is the point where 2 fractions converge soo
